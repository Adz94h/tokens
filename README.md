Step 2: Wrap this ordinal into an Emblem Vault NFT (ERC-721) https://emblem.finance/nft?id=61169675593744111

Step 3: Use fractional.art to fractionalize the wrapped NFT (ERC-721) into 21bil $shiBTC tokens (ERC-20) https://fractional.art/vaults/shibtc

Step 4: Add $shiBTC liquidity to Uniswap

And there you have it, THE VERY FIRST Ordinal Meme coin on bitcoin ! ShiBTC utilizes fractional ownership via NFT on the Bitcoin blockchain, making it a pioneer in the crypto space.
The brilliance of the idea lies in the fact that it leverages the power of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the most prominent cryptocurrencies in the market.

shiBTC is a prime example of how a memecoin can make history and disrupt the crypto industry. With its unique creation process and story, it has the potential to become the next big thing in the world of cryptocurrency

# The assembled lists

This repository has the tokens as single files. This makes it easier for contributors to add new tokens, for reviewers to get a good view on the change and also makes it easier to merge in tokens from other sources. Projects will most likely want to use the assembled lists. The CI server is already building them - so you can just [go to the commit-list](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/tokens/commits/master) and click on the green checkmark behind the last commit. There you see kontinuum/run - and the details link there brings to the assembled files on IPFS.
